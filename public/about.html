    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Tommy I am 48 years old. I have worked in the electronic
      industry for almost 30 years. Although I have enjoyed this its not really
      where my pation lies. I was always interested in computers as a young man
      but back then there werent the same opperunity.

      My kids are all grown up
      now so it now time to look at what I liked to do as a job rather than what
      i need to do. I have took the last year taking multiple courses on htlm
      css javascrit and css. Through this portfolio you will see my progress
